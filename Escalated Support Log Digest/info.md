# Escalated Support Log Digest
## Background
* Solution Engineers at Epic are responsible for ensuring customers can have successful implementations and support of Epic products
* When Epic escalates a software issue, Solution Engineers for the primary affected product must partner with the necessary customer IT teams and executives to ensure proper workarounds are in place until released fixes are installed in customer environments.
* Support Logs are used to track communication with customers. Once all fixes are installed in production environments, the support log can be closed.
* The average Solution engineer may have 8-10 open escalated logs at any given time per customer – most Solution Engineers oversee support for 4-6 customers


## Outcomes & Feedback
* Saves Solutions Engineers 15 mins/week/customer (~250,000 hours annually)
* Escalated logs are closing 62% faster since this digest went live, meaning customer issues are getting resolved faster in production
* “Just wanted to let you know, I really enjoy the weekly escalated child SLG email. I brought this up at my small team meeting last week as something that was helping me improve my customer responsiveness…just wanted to make sure you know there are people out there who appreciate all of the hard work you put into it and are getting use out of it” – Radiology Solutions Engineer
* “I just want to say that I LOVE these emails.  I was just waiting around for a fix on both of these child SLGs, and it was the perfect reminder to check in on them.  I was able to close both of them in <5 minutes, likely a couple of weeks before I would’ve closed them otherwise. Thanks for setting this up!  It’s a huge timesaver!” – Radiology Solutions Engineer
